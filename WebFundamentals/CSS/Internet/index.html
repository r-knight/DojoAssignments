					<h4>Clients and Servers</h4>
					<p>Computers connected to the <span class = "lightBlue">Web</span> are called <span class = "bold">clients</span> and <span class = "bold">servers.</span></p>
					<ul>
						<li><span class = "lightBlue">Clients</span> are the typical Web user's Internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected
						to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and <span class = "lightBlue">Web-accessing software</span> available
						on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).</li>
						<li><span class = "lightBlue">Servers</span> are computers that store <span class = "lightBlue">webpages</span>, <span class = "lightBlue">sites</span>, or <span class = "lightBlue">apps</span>. When a client device wants to access a
						webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be
						displayed in the user's web browser.</li>				
					</ul>

					<h4>So What Actually Happens?</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>The browser goes to the <span class = "lightBlue">DNS server</span> and finds the real address of the <span class = "lightBlue">server</span> that the website lives on.</li>
						<li>The browser sends an <span class = "lightBlue">HTTP request</span> message to the server asking it to send a copy of the website to
						the client.</li>
						<li>If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a <span class = "lightBlue">"200 OK" message</span>, which
						means "Permission granted! Here you go!", and then starts sending the website's files to the browser
						as a series of small chunks.</li>
						<li>The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete website and displays it to you!</li>				
					</ol>

						<br><br>
						While the server can process information in many different languages, the files that
						they serve to the client are <span class ="italic">always</span> going to be some combination of HTML, CSS,
						and JavaScript!
